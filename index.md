Welcome to my personal website. I specialize in data analysis, 
numerical computation, and leveraging machine learning to 
interpret and predict trends within the financial sector.

I began my journey in theoretical physics, earning a PhD and
completing postdoctoral research at institutions such as the
Technical University of Dortmund, Germany and Uppsala University, Sweden. 

My career transitioned into finance, where I joined Deutsche Bank.
Currently, I work as a Model Developer, creating algorithms and 
models to navigate the complex and dynamic world of financial risk.


**Here are some of projects that I work on in my free time.**
 
 -  nrgplusplus: a modern c++ implementation of Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG)
	 -   source code : [https://github.com/srbhp/nrgplusplus](https://github.com/srbhp/nrgplusplus)
	 -  Documentations [srbhp.github.io/nrgplusplus/](https://srbhp.github.io/nrgplusplus/ "https://srbhp.github.io/nrgplusplus/")
 -  **[piepdf](https://github.com/srbhp/piepdf)**  : GUI tool to manage Research articles, pdfs




**Here are the some of topics that I worked on in the past**

 - Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG) and slave-boson mean field theory for magnetic impurity in a BCS superconductor 
 - Non-equilibrium molecular spin systems, Keldysh formalism 
 - Strongly correlated electron-phonon coupled system,
 - Collective modes/Higgs Modes of discorded  Superconductors   
 - Entanglement in Quantum spin systems.
 - Disorder effects in strongly correlated electronic systems. 
 - Computational Many-body Techniques such as Monte-Carlo and Variational methods in correlated electron systems.
