Hey there, welcome to my digital playground! Iâ€™m all about crunching numbers,
diving into data, and harnessing the power of machine learning to make sense 
of the financial world.

Back in the day, I was knee-deep in theoretical physics, earning my stripes 
with a PhD and bouncing around institutions like the Technical University 
of Dortmund and Uppsala University. But then, I made the leap into the 
wild world of finance, landing a gig at Deutsche Bank.

Nowadays, you'll find me in the trenches as a Model Developer, cooking up all
sorts of clever algorithms and models to tackle the ever-shifting landscape of
financial risk. But that's just the tip of the iceberg.


**Here are some of projects that I work on in my free time.**
 
 -  nrgplusplus: a modern c++ implementation of Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG)
	 -   source code : [https://github.com/srbhp/nrgplusplus](https://github.com/srbhp/nrgplusplus)
	 -  Documentations [srbhp.github.io/nrgplusplus/](https://srbhp.github.io/nrgplusplus/ "https://srbhp.github.io/nrgplusplus/")
 -  **[piepdf](https://github.com/srbhp/piepdf)**  : GUI tool to manage Research articles, pdfs




**Here are the some of the things that I worked on in the past **

 - Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG) and slave-boson mean field theory for magnetic impurity in a BCS superconductor 
 - Non-equilibrium molecular spin systems, Keldysh formalism 
 - Strongly correlated electron-phonon coupled system,
 - Collective modes/Higgs Modes of discorded  Superconductors   
 - Entanglement in Quantum spin systems.
 - Disorder effects in strongly correlated electronic systems. 
 - Computational Many-body Techniques such as Monte-Carlo and Variational methods in correlated electron systems.
