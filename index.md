Hey there, welcome to my digital playground! Iâ€™m all about crunching numbers, diving into data, and harnessing the power of machine learning to make sense of the financial world.

Back in the day, I was knee-deep in theoretical physics, earning my stripes with a PhD and bouncing around some top-notch institutions like the Technical University of Dortmund and Uppsala University. But then, I made the leap into the wild world of finance, landing a gig at none other than Deutsche Bank.

Nowadays, you'll find me in the trenches as a Model Developer, cooking up all sorts of clever algorithms and models to tackle the ever-shifting landscape of financial risk. But that's just the tip of the iceberg.


Here are some of projects that I work on in my free time.

Here are the some of the things that I worked on 
 - Numerical Renormalization Group (NRG) and slave-boson mean field theory for
     magnetic impurity in a BCS superconductor 
 - Non-equilibrium molecular spin systems, Keldysh formalism 
 - Electron-phonon coupled system, Superconductivity, Collective Modes 
 - Entanglement in quatum spin systems.
 - Magnetic and electronic properties of Manganites.
 - Disorder effects in strongly correlated electronic systems. 
 - Computational Many-body Techniques such as Monte-Carlo and variational methods in correlated electron systems.
